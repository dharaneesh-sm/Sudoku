This project is a simple implementation of the classic Sudoku puzzle game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a set of predefined puzzles without additional levels. Players can fill in the 9x9 grid by clicking on cells and typing numbers from 1 to 9. The game validates inputs automatically and provides feedback on completion.

Enjoy playing Sudoku!
